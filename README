Shi-tsu
by Sean Whetten

A simple file-system watching command line tool. Takes as input a directory path and outputs the
path of any file that changes in that directory, like a small annoying dog that barks at every
little discrepancy it can see through the window.

Basically just a very simple command line wrapper for C#'s FileSystemWatcher class.
